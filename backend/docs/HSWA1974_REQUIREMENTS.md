## Key Legal Terms

### "So Far As Is Reasonably Practicable"

This is the standard applied throughout HSWA 1974. It means:
- **Duty is not absolute** - balance of risk against cost/time/trouble
- **If risk is high**, cost is less relevant
- **If risk is low**, cost may be considered
- **Must be justifiable** - not just convenient

**Use in Proposals:**
- State "so far as is reasonably practicable" when referencing duties
- Show how risk assessments inform "reasonably practicable" decisions
- Demonstrate that health and safety is not compromised for cost

- **HSWA 1974** = Primary legislation (general duties)
- **CDM 2015** = Specific regulations for construction projects

**Both must be addressed in proposals:**
- CDM 2015 provides specific construction requirements
- HSWA 1974 provides underlying general duties
- Together they ensure comprehensive health and safety management

**In Proposals:**
- Address HSWA 1974 general duties
- Address CDM 2015 specific construction requirements
- Show how they integrate in your approach
- Reference both in relevant sections

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ❌

1. **Not mentioning HSWA 1974** - It's mandatory for all employers
2. **Vague compliance statements** - Must reference specific sections
3. **Missing Section 3** - Duties to public are critical in construction
4. **Not explaining employee duties** - Sections 7-8 must be communicated
5. **Ignoring "reasonably practicable"** - Key legal concept that must be understood
6. **Separating HSWA and CDM** - They work together, show integration
