## Project Types

### Notifiable Projects

Projects are **notifiable** if:

**Additional Requirements for Notifiable Projects:**
- Principal Designer **must** be appointed
- Principal Contractor **must** be appointed
- HSE notification (F10 form) must be submitted
- More detailed pre-construction information required
- Enhanced construction phase plan requirements

### Small Projects

Small projects are still subject to CDM 2015, but a **proportionate approach** is acceptable.

**Still Required:**
- Duty holder identification
- Basic construction phase plan
- Appropriate welfare facilities
- Worker competence verification
- Health and safety file (even for small projects)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ❌

1. **Assuming CDM 2015 doesn't apply** - It applies to ALL projects
2. **Vague duty holder identification** - Name specific individuals/organizations
3. **Focusing only on construction phase** - Address all phases (pre-construction, construction, handover)
4. **Generic risk statements** - Provide project-specific risk assessments
5. **No mention of health and safety file** - It's mandatory for all projects
6. **Insufficient welfare facility details** - Be specific about location, type, maintenance

## Winning Strategies 🏆

1. **Visual Aids**: Include organograms showing duty holder relationships
2. **Case Studies**: Provide examples of previous CDM 2015 compliant projects
3. **Third-Party Verification**: Mention audits, certifications, external validations
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Show lessons learned and improvement processes
5. **Innovation**: Demonstrate use of technology for CDM compliance
6. **Integration**: Show how CDM requirements are integrated throughout proposal
7. **Detail**: Provide specific, detailed responses rather than generic statements
8. **Evidence**: Support claims with qualifications, certifications, experience

## Evaluation Criteria

Evaluators will assess:

- **Understanding**: Do you understand CDM 2015 requirements?
- **Practical Application**: Can you apply CDM 2015 in practice?
- **Competence**: Are your people and organization competent?
- **Comprehensiveness**: Have you addressed all requirements?
