## Proposal Requirements

Every proposal must:
- **Explicitly state compliance** with Building Regulations 2010
- **Demonstrate understanding** of relevant Parts (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q)
- **Show Building Control coordination** and application process

- "Compliance with Part [A/B/C/etc.] of Building Regulations"
- "Qualified [engineer/designer] for Building Regulations"
- "Building Control inspections arranged and attended"
- "Completion certificates obtained"
- "All relevant Parts of Building Regulations addressed"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not mentioning Building Regulations** - Mandatory for all building work
2. **Not addressing all relevant Parts** - Must show which Parts apply and how compliance is achieved
3. **No Building Control coordination** - Must show how Building Control is engaged
4. **Missing qualified persons** - Must identify qualified designers/engineers for each Part
5. **No compliance verification process** - Must show how compliance is checked and verified

## Integration with Other Regulations

Building Regulations work with:
- **CDM 2015** - Health and safety in construction
- **HSWA 1974** - General health and safety duties
- **Planning requirements** - Must be considered together
- **Other construction regulations** - Integrated approach required

## Evaluation Considerations

Evaluators will check:
- **Regulatory Knowledge:** Do you understand Building Regulations?
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Have you addressed all relevant Parts?
- **Building Control:** Do you understand the Building Control process?
- **Qualified Persons:** Do you have competent designers/engineers?
- **Compliance Process:** How do you ensure and verify compliance?

---

**Remember:** Building Regulations compliance is mandatory and non-negotiable. Your proposal must demonstrate complete understanding and practical application of all relevant Parts, along with effective Building Control coordination.
