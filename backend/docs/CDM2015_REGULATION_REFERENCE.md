## Evaluation Considerations

Evaluators will check:

1. **Regulatory Knowledge:** Do you understand CDM 2015 regulations?
2. **Specific Compliance:** Have you addressed each relevant regulation?
3. **Practical Application:** Can you apply regulations in practice?
4. **Completeness:** Have you covered all applicable duties?
5. **Evidence:** Do you have competent persons and systems?

## Common Failures

Proposals often fail because they:
- Don't reference specific regulation numbers
- Use vague language instead of specific duties
- Don't identify duty holders by name
- Miss specific duties (e.g., display notification for notifiable projects)
- Don't show how duties will be fulfilled in practice
- Focus on some duties but ignore others

## Best Practice

**DO:**
- Reference specific regulation numbers
- Identify duty holders by name and qualifications
- Detail specific processes for fulfilling each duty
- Show integration between different duties
- Provide evidence of competence and experience
- Use regulation-specific language

**DON'T:**
- Use generic statements without regulation references
- Assume evaluators know what you mean
- Skip duties you think don't apply
- Use vague phrases like "we will comply"
- Focus only on construction phase (remember pre-construction)

---

**Remember:** CDM 2015 compliance is mandatory and non-negotiable. Your proposal must demonstrate complete understanding and practical application of every relevant regulation.
