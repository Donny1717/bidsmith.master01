## Proposal Checklist

For each relevant Part, proposals must:

- [ ] Demonstrate understanding of the Part requirements
- [ ] Show qualified designers/engineers for the Part
- [ ] Detail how compliance will be achieved
- [ ] Explain compliance verification process
- [ ] Show coordination with Building Control
- [ ] Reference the Part explicitly (e.g., "Building Regulations Part A")

## Building Control Requirements

All building work requires:
- Building Notice or Full Plans application
- Building Control inspections at key stages
- Completion certificates
- Coordination throughout the project

## Integration with Other Regulations

Building Regulations must be integrated with:
- **CDM 2015** - Construction health and safety
- **HSWA 1974** - General health and safety duties
- **Planning requirements** - Must be considered together

---

**Quick Tip:** Proposals should explicitly list which Parts apply to the project and demonstrate how compliance will be achieved for each relevant Part.
